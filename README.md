# MonsteriBot-Game-Colour-Analyzer
A program that pulls the top 100 games of each specified genre from IGDB, gets their images and analyzes their average colours.

# To use:

### In the commandline:
`python getimages.py <your IGDB client ID> <your IGDB client secret> <the number of images per genre you want (less is faster but less accurate results>`
### then run
`python analyzeimages.py`

Special thanks to Crypdos for helping with the requests part of getimages.py
